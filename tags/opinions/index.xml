I heard the outage after nearly one day later. When I took a look about the issues about what is going on, too much different information is there. I have to confess that I really surprised about the incident. I can’t suggest any solution or kind of approach only I try to criticize it and ask questions while writing this post.</description></item></channel></rss>
